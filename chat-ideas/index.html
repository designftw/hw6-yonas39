      <p>Interviewing and Key Insights</p>
      <span>
        The list below is a detailed summary of the interviews I conducted and
        the keyinsights.
      </span>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preferred mode of communication: All three participants preferred text
          over voice or video. They found it to be more convenient and less
          intrusive. These influenced their messaging app choice. They looked
          for apps with a good texting interface and features like read
          receipts, typing indicators, and message search.
        </li>
        <li>
          Intuitive user interfaces: Participants found messaging apps with
          simple and clean user interfaces to be the most intuitive. They
          appreciated features such as the ability to customize chat
          backgrounds, font size, and color schemes. They found messaging apps
          that had cluttered or confusing interfaces to be frustrating to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Challenges faced while using messaging apps: Participants mentioned
          that one of their biggest challenges was managing multiple
          conversations and keeping track of important information such as
          dates, times, and locations. They also said finding specific messages
          or conversations in the app could be difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          Miscommunication or misunderstandings: Two out of three participants
          had experienced miscommunication or misunderstandings in messaging
          apps. One participant had sent a message that was misinterpreted by
          the recipient, while another had received an unclear message. They
          suggested that better communication features such as voice or video
          calls, emojis, or more precise language could have avoided these
          situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Essential features in messaging apps: Participants mentioned that the
          most critical elements in a messaging app were text formatting
          options, the ability to send images, videos, and documents, group chat
          options, message search, and customizable notification settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conversation management: Participants mentioned that they typically
          managed their conversations by categorizing them into different
          folders or using labels or tags. They also used features such as an
          archive or deleted to keep their chat list organized.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notification preferences: All participants preferred to receive push
          notifications for new messages, but with customizable settings such as
          the ability to turn off notifications for specific chats or during
          certain times of the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          In-built language options: All participants mentioned they would
          appreciate messaging apps with built-in language options. They
          suggested that this would be particularly useful for users who
          communicate with people from different regions or countries.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <span
        >Based on these findings, a messaging app should prioritize features
        such as text formatting options, the ability to send images, videos, and
        documents, group chat options, message search, and customizable
        notification settings. The app should also have a clean and intuitive
        user interface that is easy to navigate. Additional features, such as
        categorizing conversations, labels, or tags, are also important.
        Finally, the app should have customizable language options to cater to a
        global audience.</span
